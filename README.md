# SundownWatch
Stay vigilant from the ghosts of the past

Racial discrimination in the United States has not gone away. For many, it is still a stark reality, and settling in or driving through the wrong community may prove to be dangerous. Hotbeds of such activity are Sundown Towns, which cling on to the racist skeletons of the past. In this age of technology, it was surprising that no mobile application existed that would allow a person of color to know whether one of these towns existed near themselves. Sundown Watch was born to solve this problem. The application will allow users to locate such towns with both map and list interfaces. With these locations, people of color can navigate more safely around the United States. 

Using the XCode IDE, Apple’s Swift programming language, and a database of these towns, I built the application and ran it using XCode’s simulator. The application allows the users to toggle between two main pages that respectively display a map with the Sundown Towns as pins, and a list of states with the Sundown Towns listed beneath them. The expectation is that on the map page, the pins should be geographically accurate and match up to the list on the state page. This was found to be true. External testing was not possible due to financial restraints required for publishing on the App Store, but the simulation was adequate for confirmation.
